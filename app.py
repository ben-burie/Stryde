"""
TO DO:
    -Verify data accuracy
    -Initialize database
    -Fix files reading/writing to csvs instead of database
    -Review cleaning and rolling reatures code and clean it up
    -Separete ML code away from app.py (for Flask later)
        -Call script dataPrep or something like that


FUTURE PLANS:
    -Use VDOT trend to "predict future VDOT" (ML model)
    -Display most recent VDOT on home screen, along with future VDOT mentioned above

NEXT STEP:
    -Work on future VDOT predictor ML model (which in turn...gives future race projections)
        -Possible implement future vdot trend predictions for multiple time periods (e.g.: 1 month, 3 months, 6 months)
        -Future race times for all of these periods as well
